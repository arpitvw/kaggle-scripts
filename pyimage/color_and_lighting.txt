        center of the axis.
        a-channel: Originates from the center of the L-channel and defines pure green on one end of the spectrum and pure red on the other.
        b-channel: Also originates from the center of the L-channel, but is perpendicular to the a-channel. The b-channel defines pure blue at
        one of the spectrum and pure yellow at the other.
